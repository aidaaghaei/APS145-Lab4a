# Recipe for Mousaka 
## Ingredience : 2 large eggplants, peeled and cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch thick slices
salt to taste
¼ cup olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1 pound lean ground beef/lamb
3 onions, chopped
2 clove garlic, minced
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons dried parsley
½ teaspoon fines herbs
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg, divided
1 (3ounce) can tomato sauce
½ cup red wine
1 large egg, beaten
3 cups milk
½ cup butter
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
ground white pepper, to taste
1 ½ cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese ##



1. Lay eggplant slices on paper towels, sprinkle with salt, and let sit for 30 minutes to draw out moisture. Pat dry with paper towels.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the eggplant slices until golden brown, 2–3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and set aside.
3. Make the meat sauce:In a large skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Add ground beef, onions, and garlic; season with salt and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until beef is browned (about 8-10 minutes).
4. Add parsley, fines herbs, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir in tomato sauce and wine, mixing well. Simmer for 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Let the mixture cool a bit before stirring in the beaten egg.
5. Make the béchamel sauce:In a saucepan over medium heat, scald the milk (warm it until steam rises, but don’t let it boil).
6. Meanwhile, in a separate large skillet, melt 1/2 cup butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour until smooth, then gradually pour in the scalded milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps.
7. Lower the heat and let the sauce thicken (about 3-5 minutes). Season with salt, white pepper, and ground nutmeg. Remove from heat and stir in 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.
8. Assemble the moussaka:Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
9. Arrange a layer of eggplant in the bottom of the dish. Top with half of the meat sauce, followed by 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan.
10. Add another layer of eggplant and sprinkle the second 1/2 cup of Parmesan on top.
11. Pour the béchamel sauce over the entire dish, making sure to cover evenly. Sprinkle with remaining nutmeg and top with the remaining Parmesan cheese.
12. Bake:Place the dish in the oven and bake for 45-60 minutes until bubbly and golden brown on top.
13. Let it cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing to allow the layers to set.
14. Serve and enjoy:Slice and serve warm. You can garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or basil, if you like!
